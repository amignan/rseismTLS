\item{t.postinj}{the time vector for which a seismicity rate is predicted}

\value{
A data frame of the modelled seismicity rate with parameters:
\itemize{
\item \code{t} the time (in decimal days)
\item \code{rate} the seismicity rate, or number of events at time \code{t}
}
}
\description{
Statistical model proposed by Mignan et al. (2017) that predicts the
co-injection induced seismity rate via the linear relationship with flow rate
and the post-injection rate via exponential decay.
}
\details{
The linear relationship is in agreement with the literature (Dinske and Shapiro,
2013; Mignan, 2016; van der Elst et al., 2016). The exponential model was
verified to perform best when tested on 6 stimulations (Mignan et al., 2017).

The flow rate is here defined as \code{dV}, the volume injected in the period (t-dt, dt) with \code{dt}
defined in the \code{data.bin()} function. The seismicity rate is modelled for the same time vector
as \code{inj} for co-injection and uses \code{t.postinj} for post-injection.
